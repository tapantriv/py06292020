# This lab is about List
#lists are created with square brackets []
#items within a list have order
#lists are mutable; new items may be added, old items removed, and the list reordered
#The name 'list' is used by Python, the term 'array' is used for a nearly identical concept within JSON
myList= ['12','twelve',12]
# Print first item from the list
print(myList[0])
# print second item from the lsit
print(myList[1])
# Print third item fro the lsit
print(myList[2])
#print all item from the list
print(myList)
